Competitive Minesweeper - Non-AI

This is a no-AI exercise. Please do not use LLM engines, or AI code completion.

This is your starting point :

Your task is to convert it into a client-server application where two players start **on the same board** 
and then compete who can solve the board faster.

comparison between time.

1. While you don't need a "player ready" UI, if only one client starts it should be impossible to play. 
2. Timer should start when both players connected.
3. When a player wins both players' games should be stoped with "Player A/B won". Player A is the client that connected first.
4. Choice of protocol and library for client-server communication is up to your discretion and experience.




let's make it only for 2 users. When 2 users are in no new user can enter. 

Requirements:
1. live communication betwen client and server.
    a. short polling
    b. websockets (data will be accepted from both the players, with variation on the message format.
        will do processing based on how message format varies.)

    data actually only need to be sent on each click (can also use api here, with a webhook kind of thing)

    on game start, both players connect to the socket. and send data. on their format. 
    on the tkinter, let's accept a player name field as well. that will differentiate the players. (if have time.)

2. timer on the server. 
    games are independent. Only resource shared between 2 players is the time, and win/lose condition.

The game can be hosted on the frontend with a webpage. 


3. When a player loses first, the other player automatically wins
4. So, let's just create a seperate application. And update this one where each move is being sent to the server as well. 

5. Additional things like:
    malpractice by individual users can be identified. And
